# stl3d
A set of C functions that reads in and rotates and/or scales STL (stereolithography) files (for 3D printing, CAD, etc)

These are a set of APIs that will allow the user to read in a binary STL file (commonly used for 3D printing, CAD, etc) and allow the user to rotate and/or scale the file. This is written as an exercise to learn the file format of STL files.

More information on them can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)
